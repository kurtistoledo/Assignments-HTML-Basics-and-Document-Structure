        <li>Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined.</li>
        <li>Stir in the chocolate chips and chopped nuts (if using) until evenly distributed throughout the dough.</li>
        <li>Drop rounded tablespoons of dough onto the prepared baking sheets, spacing them about 2 inches apart.</li>
